P4AU notes:

+0x146416 runs on training mode reset, could be round reset-like, but don't need it rn
+0x19F160 runs on both players any hit and maybe knockdowns?. acts weird w/yukari bc her autocombo moves increment the combo count more than they hit, but it works as expected w/Yu
+0x1760E8C5 runs on either players any block. doesn't have blockstun and potentially other data filled yet, so need another


non-offset note: game won't take controller input for me unless I wait for it to fullscreen and start loading before alt-tabbing to the console window

chardata struct is at most 0xB158 bytes long

personas have their own chardata, with the same structure as players w/a pointer in the player struct
p1's chardata does end at the beginning of p2's, but functionally there's no useful data after the last offset I have in this project

+0x14D1A9 runs whenever GameState changes (menus, CSS, etc), but runs every frame in match, so no
+0x10BD16 runs whenever GameState changes, USE

there are many functions that set match state, which makes it annoying to figure out where to BP
